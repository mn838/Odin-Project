## How does the internet work?

- the backbone of the Web, the technical infrastructure that makes the Web possible
- large network of computers which communicate all together

#### Simple network

- when two computers need to communicate, you have to link them
- networks are not limited to two computers
- to connect numerous computers together, all computers are connected to a special tiny computer called a router
  - router makes sure that a message sent from a given computer arrives at the right destination computer

#### A network of networks

- connections between routers are possible, which allow us to scale infinitly
- modem
  - telephone infratructure aready connects your house with anyone in the world and reuires a modem
  - turns information from our network into information manageable by the telephone infrastructure
- ISP - Internet Service Provider
  - connect our networks to an ISP
  - a company that manages some special routers that are all linked together and can also access other ISP's routers

#### Finding Computers

- each computer has a special IP(Internet Protocol) address

#### Internet and the web

- internet is a technical infrastructure which allows billions of computers to be connected all together
- web is built on top of this infrastructure which send messages intelligible to web browsers

#### Intranets and Extranets

- intranets - private networks that are restricted to members of a particular organization
- extranets - open all or part of a private network to allow sharing and collaboration with other organizations
